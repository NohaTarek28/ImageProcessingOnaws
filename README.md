In order to avoid a single point of failure, this project uses a master script that runs on the client, sends messages to the queue (SQS), and saves images to an S3 bucket. As the other instances (EC2) communicate through that queue, it selects a job from which to do various operations on images, such as dilation, erosion, color inversion, and so forth. Following completion of all processing, a message is sent to the queue so that the worker node can put the generated image in an S3 bucket and the master can fetch it and save it locally.
